# GraphQL data model for Prisma
#
# Anytime this schema is updated you need to deploy it to Prisma via:
#
#   npm run deploy
#
# The post-deploy hoot (prisma.yml) automatically downloads the new generated
# Prisma GraphQL schema at src/generated/prisma.graphql that is the schema
# that our Yoga server can talk to the Prisma layer with.
